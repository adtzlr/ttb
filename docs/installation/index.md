# Installation

This Toolbox is a fortran module which can be used inside modern Fortran compilers. For compatibility reasons to commercial FEM Software packages it is written in _Fixed Format_.

## Installation Requirements
This Toolbox is tested on Linux and Windows with both Intel Fortran >2015 and GFortran >6.3. It has been succesfully used with Marc, Abaqus and LS Dyna.

## Download
[Download the module](https://github.com/adtzlr/ttb/archive/main.zip), put the `ttb`-Folder in your working directory and you are ready to dive into comfortable tensor manipulations in Fortran.
