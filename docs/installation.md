This Toolbox is a fortran module which can be used inside modern Fortran compilers. For compatibility reasons to commercial FEM Software packages it is written in _Fixed Format_.

## Installation Requirements
This Toolbox is tested on Windows with both Intel Fortran 2015 and GFortran 6.3. If you are using Linux it **should** work (but it is untested).

## Download
[Download the module](https://github.com/adtzlr/ttb/archive/master.zip), put the `ttb`-Folder in your working directory and you are ready to dive into comfortable tensor manipulations in Fortran.
